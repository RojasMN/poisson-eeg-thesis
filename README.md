# Interpreting Human EEG as a Filtered Poisson Process: Kernel Parameterization and Spectral Properties
---
This repository contains the code used for EEG signal processing, computational simulations, and statistical analysis of the project. In addition, the Igor Pro 9.0 file 'data_eeg_v7.pxp' also contains EEG data, with its respective spectral estimation and $\Psi$ reconstructions.
