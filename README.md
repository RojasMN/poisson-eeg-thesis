# Interpreting Human EEG as a Filtered Poisson Process: Kernel Parameterization and Spectral Properties
---
This repository contains the code used for EEG signal processing, computational simulations, and statistical analysis for the project. Additionally, the Igor Pro 9.0 file 'data_eeg_v7.pxp' includes EEG data, along with the corresponding spectral estimations and Î¨ reconstructions.
